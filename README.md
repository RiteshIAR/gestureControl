# BYTESTROKES: GESTURE CONTROL USING MATLAB

## MATLAB codes for various gesture controls

- All the MATLAB files end with extension .m and arduino codes (for actuator control) end with .ino
- Detailed explanantion of each project can be found at [bytestrokes](https://bytestrokes.wordpress.com/category/tech/)

### How To Run codes

* You will need a PC with MATLAB and Arduino IDE installed.
* Open the MATLAb codes in MATLAB and equivalent Arduino code in Arduino IDE
* Plug in your Arduino controller to your PC and upload the Arduino code.
* Mention the right Serial Port in the code and run the .m scirpt in MATLAB.
